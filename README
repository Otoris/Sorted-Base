Sorted Base
=================

This is my base theme I created to better understand how to work with Wordpress. It is meant to be a starting point to create themes of all sizes.

Goals of Sorted Base:

* HTML5 Wireframe
* Some HTML5 Boilerplate built-in
* Legacy Browser Compatible (Mostly)
* Fluid Layout
* Twitter Integrated
* All Wordpress Content Post Formats included. (Image Posts, Quote Posts, etc.)
* Not bloated at all. Do not want.

I'll link to a simple document to get a jumpstart on using this base further into development.
